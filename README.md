​​In collaboration with Aerial Knights, LLC, we present this video game publishing agreement “how-to” guide to help you elevate your game to the next level. As a video game attorney passionate about this industry, I am thrilled to share this resource and support your success!

Video game developers should confidently advocate for fair terms in their publishing agreements, seeking the assistance of an experienced attorney to ensure they receive the compensation and rights they deserve, rather than settling for less simply to secure a publisher’s backing. Before signing, developers and their counsel should thoroughly research publishers and reach out to former development partners to understand their working relationships and potential pitfalls. Given the current state of the industry, we created this template guide to provide valuable insights into these common agreements, offering general yet helpful information that developers need.
